# Testing: Basic Unit Testing
Level: *Subsidiary Sloth*

<img src="./assets/sloth_badge.svg" width="30%" height="auto" alt="subsidiary_sloth">

You have learned how to build basic webcomponents but do you also know how to improve them on the go? In this section you will learn more about unit testing and the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. This means in short, test cases are created before code is written. The purpose of TDD is to make the code clearer, simple and bug-free.

> Goal: You know how to improve code quality through types and unit tests.

---

## Preparation
Read about TDD and learn the difference between Jest, Mocha and Chai. When you feel ready set up Jest (look up links in the resources).
If you have installed Jest globally you can just write in your terminal `jest` and it will run your test file.

## TDD

### Challenge
Starting with TDD: Write a test for a function that checks if a dashed string is converted to camel case.

`_Convert_me_to_camel_case_ => convertMeToCamelCase`

Write 7-10 tests for your function.


**Notes:**
- Start with the simplest test.
- You do not need any HTML in order to test your function.
- Everything the test needs should be included inside the test.

Example:
```
/* example.js */

const yourFunction = (parameter) => {
  //Your solution to the test
};

module.exports = {
  yourFunction
};
```
```
/* example.test.js */

const {
  yourFunction
} = require ('./example');

test('test requirements'), () => {
  expect(yourFunction(parameter)).toBe(undefined);
};
```
### Questions
<questions-component>
  <question-component>What's the difference between unit and integration tests?</question-component>
  <answer-component>Unit tests, as they say only test the smallest units of a program. Normally, one function at a time. Integration tests on the other hand, test that the building blocks of an program work together as they should.</answer-component>
  <question-component>Why do we use TDD? And do you think it's a good idea?</question-component>
  <answer-component>TDD ensures that we only code what we need to and the we do not break anything after it already worked. It also helps us to create clean code.</answer-component>
  <question-component>What are Mocha, Chai and Jest and what are these three libraries doing?</question-component>
  <answer-component>Mocha is a test runner with a very basic set of test functions. Chai adds to mocha a lot of test functions to test specific cases. Jest is an all in one solution which does not need a lot of configuration.</answer-component>
