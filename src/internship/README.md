### Getting started

The first part of your journey is to get an overview of the topics, that will come across during your first weeks. You will learn which vision the onboarding process follows and get in touch with our toolset. You will be assigned a mentor and also buddies for each lesson.
You have to organize your accounts and tools and afterwards this roadmap will be adjusted to your individual skills. Besides that you will also get an introduction to the development manifesto and StencilJS.

*Goal: You will have a basic understanding of our Manifesto and StencilJS. You can start right away and know where you are heading without being over- or underchallenged.*
