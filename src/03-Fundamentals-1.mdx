# Fundamentals I: HTML Semantics, Layout and Styling
Level: *Busy Blackbird*

You have already learned about our Manifesto, Biotope and have an overview of the first steps of this Roadmap.
In this Level you will learn how to write mobile first responsive web pages with HTML5 and CSS and how to create and use SVG Icons and Webfonts.

## Preparation
In this challenge you will learn how to create your own repository on GitHub, how to use Git and how you can use HTML5 Boilerplate for the following challenges.

### Resources
- Git Clients: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Pro Git Book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
- HTML5 Boilerplate: https://html5boilerplate.com

### Challenge
#### Create an account on Github
If you do not have an account at Github.com already, go to: https://github.com/join and create an account
Please note that Github is a professional social network and choose an appropriate username.

#### Create a repository on Github
Login to [GitHub](http://github.com/login) and create a [new repository](https://github.com/new).

Choose a *repository name* for this project. Take a name of your own choice, be creative! - or use this level's name "busy-blackbird-page" if you're lazy :-)

#### Clone Github repository locally
If you do not have installed a git client already, find and install a [git client for your local operating system](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
With your git client, clone the new repository from github with git clone to get a local copy.

#### Get HTML5 Boilerplate
Download the HTML5 Boilerplate and extract it into your empty local repository.
Commit and push it into the repository with git.

### Questions
- What's Git?
- What is a repository?
- what is a branch?
- What is a commit?
- what does push mean?
- what does fetch mean?
- what is a pull request?
- What's the difference between Git and Github?

## Page Layout
In this challenge you will learn how to use HTML Semantic elements and how to develop mobile first responsive websites.

### Hints and Guidelines
1. Use semantic elements to structure your webpages.
2. Use CSS Grid to define the layout
3. Mobile first! Mobile first!
4. ... but can we just say, the desktop second?!

### Resources
- When to use which semantic HTML5 element: [HTML5 Element Flowchart](http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf)
- Why is CSS Grid a big deal and why should we care: [Getting Started with CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-css-grid/)
import screensZip from './assets/fundamentals-1/biotope-onboaring-fundamentals-1-screens.zip'
- Download all screens for this level: [biotope-onboaring-fundamentals-1-screens.zip](/assets/fundamentals-1/biotope-onboaring-fundamentals-1-screens.zip)

### Challenge

#### Bring your body in shape - from header to footer:
First create an html page based on the html5 boilerplate and segment it with semantic elements.  
Then add basic CSS styling for these areas to match the layout shown in the screen graphics.

Other page content shown here will be created later and is not yet part of this challenge.

#### Screens
import layout320 from './assets/fundamentals-1/screens/layout-320.png'
import layout1600 from './assets/fundamentals-1/screens/layout-1600.png'

| Mobile 320px | Desktop 1600px |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| <a href={layout320}><img src={layout320} height="1000" /></a> | <a href={layout1600}><img src={layout1600} height="1000" /></a> |

import header from './assets/fundamentals-1/screens/header.png'
import footer from './assets/fundamentals-1/screens/footer.png'

| Header | Footer |
| ------------ | -------------- |
|<a href={header}><img src={header}/></a> | <a href={footer}><img src={footer}/></a> |


## Content Structure and Webfonts
In this challenge you will learn how to structure content in html documents and how to use headlines and semantic HTML5 elements.

### Hints and Guidelines
- Use HTML5 semantic sectioning elements to structure the content
- Correctly use HTML headlines h1-h6
- Validate your HTML code!

### Resources
- HTML5 Standard on Sectioning Elements: [chapter 4.3 through 4.3.10](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#sections)
- Decision guide which HTML5 Sectioning Element to chose: [HTML5 Sectioning Flowchart](http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf)
- HTML5 suggests the so called [outline algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outline) - but it's not implemented by any browser yet!
- Instead use the [basic rank of headlines](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#rank)
- MDN web docs on [Using HTML Sections and Outlines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines)
- Adrian Roselli: [There Is No Document Outline Algorithm](http://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html)
- Dummy Text generator and origins and history of the "Lorem Ipsum" text: https://loremipsum.io/
- Dummy Image generator: https://dummyimage.com/.
- Use the [free webfont Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) with font-weight 300, 400 and 700.
- W3C HTML5 Validator: https://validator.w3.org/

### Challenge
In this challenge you will learn how to structure content in html documents and how to use headlines and semantic HTML5 elements.

#### Basic page structure
Before adding the actual content to your html page, proceed with adding more semantic sectioning elements for further structuring of the content.

#### Headlines
Add HTML5 compliant headlines and sections to structure the content of your page.

#### Inner values matter!
Add dummy text and Image content to your page, you can use dummy text and image generators for that.  
With latter you can easily create dummy images like this:
<img src="https://dummyimage.com/320x180/eef1f5/0b5fff" alt="320x180" />

#### Add some Teasers to turn them on!

Often, a combination of an image, short text and a link -  a teaser - is used to tease users to related content on other pages.
Multiple of such teasers can be combined in a teaser row.

#### Related Content
Place related content in a marginal column on the right, again chose a matching semantic element to markup this area of additional content.
You can use CSS to adjust position and size of this area.

#### Code is not valid until proven valid!
To ensure your HTML code is valid and can be correctly interpreted by browsers, search engines and screen readers, validate your code with the W3C HTML Validator.
Fix the reported validation errors in your HTML code.

#### Screens

## Navigation
In this Challenge you will learn how to build an accessible navigation and add the correct semantic elements and attributes.

### Hints and Guidelines
- Use HTML5 semantic elements to markup a navigation section
- Use a list structure for navigation links
- add additional semantics for better accessibility

### Resources
- [WAI ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/)
- [WAI ARIA W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/)
- MDN web docs: [ARIA basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics)
- [NVDA screen reader](https://www.nvaccess.org)
- [Apple iOS VoiceOver](https://help.apple.com/iphone/11/?lang=en#/iph3e2e415f)

### Challenge
#### Navigation Links
Add navigation links to the header like depicted in the screen. When clicking these links, they should lead to the subheadlines of the sections of the page.
Also consider using a semantic element for the navigation and a sensible structure of elements for the link list.

#### Additional Semantics and Accessibility
In addition to semantic elements, semantic meaning can be added to normal html elements with so called "ARIA-attributes". They were introduced by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) with the additional recommendation called "WAI ARIA" to make HTML more semantic and accessible to screen readers and search engines. You are encouraged to read more about ARIA in the WAI ARIA Overview and the WAI ARIA W3C Recommendation.

If you have a Mac or an iOS device, activate VoiceOver, let it read out your navigation and page structure and try to navigate in the webpage with VoiceOver.
If you don't have an Apple Device or operating system, get NVDA and try the same with NVDA.

If you recognize that something on your page does not work or is not accessible with screen readers, try to improve it and make it accessible.

And if you want to really judge a frontend web developer: just take his or her iPhone and tripple-click the home button ;-)

### Screens
import nav from './assets/fundamentals-1/screens/nav.png'
import navHover from './assets/fundamentals-1/screens/nav-hover.png'

| Navigation Links | Navigation Links, hover |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| <a href={nav}><img src={nav}/></a> | <a href={navHover}><img src={navHover}/></a> |

### Questions
- Which semantic element should be used for page navigation?
- How can you add semantic meaning to any HTML elements?
- Why should semantic attributes be added to html elements?
