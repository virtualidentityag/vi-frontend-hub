# Applicant
Hello fellow developer. So, you came to proof yourself. Don't look any further, we have the perfect challenge for you!  
At Virtual Identity we are convinced about the web components standards. Therefore we use them in our daily work to build platform independent frontend ecosystems. We have a high quality standard for our work and therefore take SEO and Accessibility seriously. We also want to ensure that our code quality is maintaining a high level by using automated testing.
Your challenge will be to build a component in our Component Library Template based on StencilJS. 

## Timebox
Please take a maximum of eight hours time for this challenge. We do not want you to work overtime!

## Preparations
We have a common template repository of which we start all or new projects. So please do the following in preparation of the challenge:
- Clone our [Project Template](https://github.com/virtualidentityag/component-library-template)
- Check the [stencil web page](https://stenciljs.com/) and get familiar with it

### Hints
- We use Storybook to display the components we build. Having a look at their [Page](https://storybook.js.org/ ) might help you to create a story for your component
- In our Component Library Template you will find an example component. That could be a good starting point.
