# Code Challenge

Implement the following call to action component. Sadly our designers forgot about the mobile design. Get creative and implement a responsive solution that works on all viewport sizes.

### Specifications
- Font Sizes:
  - Headline: 36px
  - Call to action title: 24px
  - Call to action description: 16px
  - Button text : 12px
  - Contact box title: 24px

- Fonts (Google Fonts)
  - Serif: Playfair Display
  - Sans Serif: Roboto Condensed

- There are no measurements for this Screen
  - Try to measure by eye. (It will not be evaluated if it is a pixel perfect match)

- Use any asset or mock image as you like
- The content next to the image is always vertical centered in the grey background
- The whole component has full page width
- A click on the call to action button opens the contact box
- Add a close button for the contact box wherever you think it would make sense from a UX standpoint
- A click on the close button closes the contact box

Good luck and have fun!
