# Employee

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Hello and welcome fellow Frontend-Dev at Virtual Identity.  
We, your new colleagues, created this page to give you a guided start during your first weeks.  
We wish you a lot of fun working with us!

## Onboarding period
Now that you started your work at VI, we want to get you onboard as smooth as possible. Therefore we have a onboarding period for every new employee depending on the employees level. After this period you should be able to work on projects and answer all the questions provided to you in our [quiz](employee/quiz).  
These periods are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Junior</td>
    <td>4 months</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Intermediate</td>
    <td>2 months</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Senior</td>
    <td>1 month</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The goal of this process is the following:
> Every new frontend developer knows about the basics of web development and is able to implement components in our StencilJS projects, in compliance with our VI standards!

## Buddy System 
You should already have started on a project by now and should have been assigned a buddy. This person is your partner in crime. He should be able to support you if you have questions about us as a company, our inner workings or any technical stuff. Please be aware, that you are still yourself responsible for your own development. The buddy will namely support you with the following measures:

1. code reviews
2. answering questions you have
3. suggest other solutions and explain why
4. give positive as well as constructive feedback on your interaction with the project team
5. support you in planning your tasks, timings and commitments
6. navigate on your progress to prevent over/underwhelming workloads

The buddy will also go through the [quiz](employee/quiz) with you and see, where ou still need to improve and which topics you already know by heart
